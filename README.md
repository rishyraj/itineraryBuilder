**Code will not run without some modifications**
1. Once cloned, open server.js in a text editor
2. Navigate to lines 35, 36 and 45
3. Notice that these lines need to be updated with sender email credentials (recommend gmail)
4. Once the credentials are updated, open itineraryBuilder.html in a web browser.
5. Open terminal and type node server.js (server.js should console log Listening on Port: 3000)
6. The email functionality should now work as intended.
